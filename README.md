# Programowanie w języku Python dla inżynierów

Python course materials for engineering master's students.

## Preparation of the repository for laboratory class

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- **uv**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git**

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository into a folder named with your **student index number**.

Replace `123456` with your actual index number:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/w10k57-git/python-for-engineers.git 123456
cd 123456
```

**Example:** If your index number is `987654`, you would run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/w10k57-git/python-for-engineers.git 987654
cd 987654
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Configure Git

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Verify your configuration:
```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

### 4. Create Your Working Branch

```bash
git checkout -b lab
```

**Important:** All students work on the `lab` branch. Never commit to `main`!

## Daily Workflow

### Getting Instructor Updates

When the instructor publishes new materials:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout lab
git merge main
```

### Working on Tasks

All your work should be done in the `tasks/` directory:

```bash
cd tasks/
uv run python your_script.py
```

### Committing Your Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete task XYZ"
```

**Note:** Your work stays local. You don't push to the remote repository.

## Examples



## Repository Structure

```
123456/  (your index number)
├── examples/       # Code examples and exercises
├── tasks/          # YOUR workspace - work here!
├── src/            # Utility functions you can use
└── data/           # Data files for the course
```

## Git Workflow Summary

- **`main`** - Course materials from instructor (read-only)
- **`lab`** - Your working branch (all students use this name)

### Key Commands

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View history
git log --oneline

# See changes
git diff
```

## Complete Setup Checklist

- [ ] Clone repository into folder named with your index number
- [ ] Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- [ ] Configure `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
- [ ] Create `lab` branch with `git checkout -b lab`
